A JSON Annotated Music Specification for Reproducible MIR Research.

What
----
JAMS is a JSON-based music annotation format. 

We provide:
*A formal JSON schema
*Python and MATLAB software libraries
*Popular datasets in JAMS format
*Python scripts for converting datasets to JAMS format

Why
----
JAMS provides a simple, structured, and sustainable format that allows rich annotations to live in a single file.

The JAMS format supports:
*multiple types annotations
*multiple annotations for a given task
*rich file level and annotation level metadata
